slide1: This presentation provides a summary of VSAT locations, service plans and spectral efficiency for __NW_NAME__.

  Plots are provided for VSAT distribution in each beam serviced by the __GW_NAME__ gateway.
  
  A month on month summary of new activations, where are these new activations happening and what serice plans are being used, all this information is provided. 
  
  Finally, the spectral efficiency of the network is presented so that this data can be combined with volume usage and service plan data.
